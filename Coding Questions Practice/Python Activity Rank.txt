# with the highest number of  emails sent will have a rank of 1,
# and so on. Output the user, total emails, and their activity
# rank. Order records by the total emails in descending order.
# Sort users with the same number of emails in alphabetical order.
# In your rankings, return a unique value (i.e., a unique rank)
